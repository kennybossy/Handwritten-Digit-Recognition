# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project focuses on building deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from the widely used MNIST dataset. The goal of this project is to design, train, and evaluate an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to classify images of digits into their respective categories.
